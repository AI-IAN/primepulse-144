## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Error Handling**: Every service must have comprehensive error handling
- **Logging**: Use Winston logger for all operations
- **Validation**: Joi schemas for all API inputs
- **Security**: API key authentication for all protected endpoints
- **Testing**: Include test coverage for new features

### Architecture Principles
- **API-First**: Build robust APIs before UI
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one concern
- **Error Isolation**: Failures in one component don't break others
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture ready for 60k ASIN scale
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Development Commands
```bash
# Core development workflow
"Implement feature: [description] for PrimePulse 144 following STANDARD complexity guidelines"
